# Movie list task

1. Clone this repository
* The repo contains an incomplete application and a sample dataset.
* This application displays a card for each of the first 200 movies in the included JSON data file
* The user can click on “like” or “dislike” for each card, although this is not functional right now
* The application makes use of https://react.semantic-ui.com/
2. Depending on your confidence, please choose and attempt a selection of the below tasks:
* Update the “like” button on the `MovieCard` component to change colour or style when clicked
* Refactor the application to separate the `Movies` and `MovieCard` components out into their own files
* Refactor to move the data filtering and mapping to its own function, seperate to the render
* Add a filter and corresponding UI element to the application, e.g. to enable users to filter the list based on release date or budget
* Add a UI component to set the number of results displayed, this is currently hardcoded to 200
* Convert one of the components to TypeScript
* Mock-up an example of how you think the applications UI could be improved, for example adding more advanced search or filtering features
* Mock-up/wireframe an example of a proposed page thath would be shown after the user clicked on a `MovieCard`
3.	When you are finished, add your modified files to a public repository, either on Github or Bitbucket
